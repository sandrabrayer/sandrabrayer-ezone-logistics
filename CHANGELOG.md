All notable changes to EZone Logistics are documented here, per the project working rule
(documentation for every change and every commit). Newest first.

## [Increment 3 · step 2b] — Dashboard action spinners + immediate board refresh

**What:** Two UX guarantees on the Roy/Sandra board: an in-flight spinner on every action button,
and an immediate board refresh after every status-change write.

**Added**
- `src/dashboard.html` — in-flight spinners on the action buttons (אישור, דחייה, דחה לתאריך,
  הקצאה לביצוע, סמן כהושלם, סגור), following the login-button pattern (#79). When a POST is in
  flight the triggering button is disabled and shows a spinner (`startSpinner`); on failure it is
  re-enabled with its label restored so the coordinator can retry. On success the board re-renders
  and the button is replaced wholesale, so no manual restore is needed. This also prevents
  double-submits (a second click while the first transition is still writing).
- `test/dashboard.test.js` — structural tests over the inline board script: spinner CSS/keyframes
  present, every action button forwards its element to the handler, each wrapper accepts and passes
  `btn` to `post`, `startSpinner` disables + spins + returns a restore, `post` spins on entry and
  restores only on write failure, and the refresh-on-write wiring (below).

**Changed**
- `src/dashboard.html` — refresh timing verified and made robust. The board already refreshed
  immediately on every status change (each write awaited a reload) — coordinators were never on a
  schedule or a manual refresh. That reload path was split into `load()` (first paint: populate the
  house filter once, then render) and `refresh()` (re-fetch requests + threshold and re-render).
  Every status-change write now calls `refresh()`, which also fixes a latent bug in the old reload:
  it re-appended the house-filter options on every action, duplicating them. `refresh()` no longer
  touches the house filter, so the immediate refresh is clean and lighter (two GETs instead of
  three).

**Why:** Without the spinner a slow Apps Script POST looked unresponsive and invited double-clicks
that fire the same transition twice. The refresh-timing task confirmed the board is live (not a
scheduled/manual digest); the split makes that live refresh correct and removes the duplicate-filter
side effect.

**Deploy note:** frontend-only change (`src/dashboard.html`). No Apps Script redeploy required.

## [Increment 3 · step 2] — Roy/Sandra dashboard (board + actions)

**What:** The dashboard where Roy and Sandra see requests by status and act on them. Wires to the
step-1 backend handlers.

**Added**
- `src/dashboard.html` — teal-themed RTL board: requests grouped by status (pending / deferred /
  approved-for-assignment / in-progress / done / rejected), summary counters, filters by house and
  maintenance lead, and a user picker (רועי / Sandra). Action buttons per request: approve, reject
  (with reason), defer-to-date, assign-to-lead, mark completed, close. The approve button is
  disabled and labelled "(סנדרה)" when the amount requires Sandra and the current user is Roy —
  mirroring the §6 rule client-side; the server enforces it regardless.

**Changed**
- `src/server.js` — now serves the dashboard at `/dashboard` (and `/dashboard.html`) in addition to
  the form at `/`, injecting `APPS_SCRIPT_EXEC_URL` into both.

**Why:** Roy needs a place to see open/closed/pending/deferred at a glance and act, and Sandra
needs the same board filtered to what she must approve. Client-side authority hints improve UX;
the step-1 server handlers are the real enforcement (status legality + approver tier + audit).

**Deploy note:** the updated `apps-script/Code.gs` (step 1) must be pasted into the Apps Script
editor and redeployed as a NEW VERSION for the dashboard actions to work live (Apps Script does not
auto-update from GitHub).

**Not yet done:** notifications/reminders (later increment); smart batching (later increment);
inspection module (§13, increment 4).

## [Increment 3 · step 1] — Approval engine + status transitions (backend)

**What:** The backend heart of the app — approval routing (§6) and status-transition rules, with
audit logging. No UI yet (the dashboard board + actions are steps 2–3).

**Added**
- `src/approval.js` — pure, testable module: `whoApproves` (≤ threshold → Roy, > threshold →
  Sandra, emergency → auto), `approvalRequired`, `canApprove` (Roy can't approve above threshold,
  Sandra can), `canTransition` (legal status moves), `validateApproval`.
- `test/approval.test.js` — 14 tests covering the threshold boundary (3000 → Roy, 3001 → Sandra),
  emergency bypass, blank cost → Roy, Sandra-vs-Roy authority, deferred wake-up re-check, and legal
  vs. illegal status transitions.

**Changed**
- `apps-script/Code.gs` — `doPost` is now a multi-action router (`createRequest`, `approve`,
  `reject`, `defer`, `assign`, `setStatus`). Mirrors the approval engine; each transition validates
  status + authority, updates the row, and writes an `AuditLog` entry (who/when/from→to).
  `createRequest` now also stamps the derived `approval_required` flag.

**Why:** Approval routing is the core rule of the app and must be locked by tests before any UI
sits on top of it. Building the engine as a pure module (like config/request) keeps it verifiable
under `node:test`; the dashboard (step 2) and its action buttons (step 3) call into it.

**Security:** every transition validated server-side (status legality + approver authority);
client cannot force an illegal state or approve above its tier; all actions audit-logged.

**Not yet done:** the dashboard board (step 2), the action buttons wired to these handlers (step 3).

## [Increment 2a] — Request submission form (no photo)

**What:** The Hebrew RTL form a maintenance lead uses to submit a request, plus the server-side
request-creation logic. A submitted request lands as a `דרישה` row. No approval logic yet (inc. 3).

**Added**
- `src/request.js` — pure, testable `validateNewRequest` + `buildNewRequest` + `generateRequestId`.
  Mirrors the `config.js` pattern so the rules run under `node:test`.
- `src/index.html` — Hebrew RTL form: submitted-by picker (controlled list), house dropdown from
  the live `?action=houses` feed, category/urgency segmented controls, description, location,
  and estimated cost (**blank allowed**). Client validation mirrors the server.
- `src/server.js` — zero-dependency Node static server; injects `APPS_SCRIPT_EXEC_URL` from env
  at serve time so the URL is never hardcoded or committed.
- `test/request.test.js` — covers blank cost accepted and kept blank, numeric cost stored as a
  number, unknown category/urgency/created_by rejected, status stamped `דרישה`, server id/time
  present, approval fields left blank.

**Changed**
- `apps-script/Code.gs` — `createRequest` now owns `id`, `status` (`דרישה`), and `created_at`
  server-side; the client no longer sends them. `validateNewRequest_` hardened against the
  controlled vocabularies (category, urgency, created_by). `approval_required` still left blank.
- `package.json` — added a `start` script (`node src/server.js`) so Railway can boot the
  frontend. `APPS_SCRIPT_EXEC_URL` (the form's submit target) is read from the environment at
  serve time and must be set as a Railway env var; it is already documented in `.env.example`.
- `src/index.html` — UI restyled to match the EZone family dark theme (cement-gray signature accent, amber/red urgency color-coding). Style/markup only; no JavaScript or form logic changed.
- `src/index.html` — Changed Logistics signature accent from cement-gray to teal. Style/markup only; no JavaScript or form logic changed.

**Why:** Requests must exist before approval routing can be meaningfully built or tested, so the
form precedes approval (inc. 3). Server-owned id/status removes collision risk and prevents the
client from spoofing lifecycle state; controlled `created_by` keeps later deferral-reminder
routing reliable.

**Security:** server-side stamping (client can't set status/id); inputs validated and
vocabularies whitelisted before write; exec URL injected from env, never committed.

**Not yet done:** optional photo upload (2b, wired to Drive); approval routing (inc. 3).

## [Increment 1] — Data model scaffold

**What:** Foundation for the whole app — the five-sheet Google Sheet structure, the Apps Script
read/write layer, seed data, and the supporting repo scaffolding.

**Added**
- `src/schema.js` — single source of truth for every sheet's column headers and the seed data
  (six houses, two internal maintenance leads, Config defaults). Shared by the Sheet setup
  script and the test suite so structure can't drift between them.
- `apps-script/setup.gs` — `setupSheet()` creates and seeds the five tabs (`Requests`, `Houses`,
  `Config`, `Technicians`, `AuditLog`) in a fresh Sheet, idempotently.
- `apps-script/Code.gs` — read/write layer only (no lifecycle/approval logic yet):
  `getConfig`/`getAllConfig` (with centralized type coercion), `getHouses`, `getTechnicians`,
  `getRequests`, `getRequestById`, `appendRequest`, `writeAuditEntry`; plus `doGet`/`doPost`
  router stub with input validation and least-privilege notes.
- `src/config.js` — pure, runtime-agnostic coercion helper (`coerceConfigValue`) extracted so it
  is unit-testable under Node without an Apps Script runtime. `Code.gs` mirrors the same rule.
- `test/` — foundation tests: schema integrity (six houses, correct cluster↔lead mapping
  including the Tzachi caesarea-vs-north split), and Config coercion (threshold returns a
  `number`, emergency-bypass returns a boolean).
- Repo scaffolding: `README.md`, `.gitignore`, `.env.example` (placeholder names only),
  `package.json`.

**Why:** Everything downstream — request submission, approval routing, assignment, batching —
reads and writes these sheets and depends on `Config` being typed correctly. Seeding `Config`
and the cluster/lead distinction now, and locking both with tests, means later increments have
nothing to hardcode and the two most error-prone rules (threshold typing, cluster ≠ lead) are
enforced structurally from day one.

**Security**
- No secrets committed. `.env.example` carries placeholder names only; real Sheet ID / Apps
  Script URL stay in the untracked `.env` (gitignored).
- Inputs validated in the `doPost` router stub before any write.
- Least-privilege intent documented in `Code.gs` (bind to this app's Sheet only).

**Not yet done (next increments):** request submission form, approval logic, assignment + status
flow, smart batching, notifications/reports.
